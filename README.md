# Token-Based Voting dApp (Just the idea)

## Overview

The **Token-Based Voting dApp** is a decentralized application (dApp) that allows users to vote on proposals using a token-based system. Each user is allocated a fixed number of tokens, which they can use to cast votes on different proposals. The number of tokens a user allocates to a proposal reflects the weight of their vote, making this system ideal for situations where more influential stakeholders have a larger say.

This dApp leverages **Ethereum blockchain technology** to ensure transparency, immutability, and decentralization of the voting process. Smart contracts handle token distribution, vote casting, and result tallying, making the voting process secure and tamper-proof.

## Key Features

- **Token Distribution**: Users are allocated a fixed number of tokens that can be used to vote.
- **Voting System**: Users can vote by assigning tokens to different proposals.
- **Proposal Submission**: Users can submit new proposals to the platform.
- **Blockchain Security**: Voting results are stored on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and preventing tampering.
- **Wallet Integration**: Connect via MetaMask to interact with the dApp.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Built with **Next.js** and **TailwindCSS** for a responsive and dynamic UI.
- **Smart Contracts**: Written in **Solidity** and deployed on Ethereum (or a compatible EVM-based blockchain like Polygon or Binance Smart Chain).
- **Blockchain Interaction**: Uses **ethers.js** to interact with smart contracts and the Ethereum network.
- **Deployment**: Deployed on Vercel (frontend) and testnet/mainnet (blockchain).

## Project Structure

- `contracts/`: Contains all Solidity smart contracts.
- `pages/`: Next.js pages for the dApp interface.
- `components/`: Reusable UI components (e.g., for proposals, voting interface).
- `test/`: Smart contract tests written using Hardhat.
- `styles/`: Global styles using Tailwind CSS.

## Getting Started

To run the dApp locally:

1. Clone the repository:
    
    `git clone https://github.com/harshsoni-harsh/token-voting-dapp.git cd token-voting-dapp`
    
2. Install dependencies:
    
    `bun install`
    
3. Compile and deploy the smart contracts:
    
    `bunx hardhat compile; bunx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js`
    
4. Start the Next.js frontend:
    
    `bun dev`
    

## Future Enhancements

- Add **token staking** for additional features.
- Implement a **results leaderboard** to show the most popular proposals.
- Add **notifications** for new proposals and voting events.
